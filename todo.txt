Changes to make and rebase into the starting setup
* Make a ./nextstep.py that steps through the changes
* In extract_code.py:

 - Rearrange imports in blogapp.py to top

* Incorporate try.py

 - Consider bpython

Slight changes to the tutorial sequence:
* With ed_user, first explicitly commit, then show flushing
* Actually get one() to work, not just generate errors

Wording:
* Check what to use for "record" etc

Not to do:
* Remove whitespace at end of non-result lines
