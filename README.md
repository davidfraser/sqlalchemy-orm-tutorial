sqlalchemy-orm-tutorial
=======================

Example of working through the standard [sqlalchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org) [ORM tutorial](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_7/orm/tutorial.html) for release `0.7`

This is to accompany an *Introduction to SQLAlchemy* talk originally done by David Fraser at [PyConZA 2012](http://za.pycon.org)

The idea is that each commit represents the state at the end of a step in the slides.

To start, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (ideally from within a clean virtual environment). Then run `python steps.py` at each stage to see the current status. The code is in doctest format in `steps.txt`
